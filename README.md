# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms - MP2

Welcome to the third assignment for **Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (YSC2229)**. This problem set will allow you to dive deep into Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Binary Heaps, and Sorting algorithms.

## Recommended Sequence

We recommend the following sequence to approach the problems:

- **Binary Trees** (4 questions)
  - `glass_towers.py`
  - `tree_diameter.py`
  - `tree_distances_one.py`
  - `tree_search_sequence.py`
  
- **Binary Search** (4 questions)
  - `next_letter.py`
  - `search_rotated_array.py`
  - `search_min_difference_element.py`
  - `count_rotations.py`
  
- **AVL Trees** (3 questions)
  - `red_black_tree.py`
  
- **Binary Heaps** (4 questions)
  - `min_heapify.py`
  - `kth_smallest_element`
  - `kth_largest_element`
  - `find_sum_of_elements.py`
  
- **Sorting** (4 questions)
  - `wiggle_sort.py`
  - `sort_an_array.py`
  - `meeting_rooms.py`
  - `h_index.py`

Remember, this sequence is a guideline; feel free to tackle the problems in the order that makes the most sense to you.

## Getting Help

- **Discussion Post**: For general questions, please post in the [discussion forum](#).
  
- **Pull Requests**: For specific questions about your code, commit, push, and open a pull request. Alternatively, post specific code questions in the GitHub discussions section.

- **Errors/Bugs/Private Queries**: Spot an issue in the problem set? Direct message @yokurang on Telegram or send an email to <alan.matthew@u.yale-nus.edu.sg>.

## Testing

You can test your solutions using `pytest`. The test cases are available in the `tests` folder. Please note, there are no hidden tests for this assignment. A green checkmark after pushing signifies that your solution is correct. However, submissions will undergo a plagiarism check using Stanford's MOSS software.

## Submission

To begin, click the assignment link and accept the invitation. This will set up a private repository for your assignment. The assignment link can be found in the Canvas description.

Push your solutions to this repository. You can push as many times as you wish; the final commit before the deadline is the one that will be graded. The submission deadline is **October 17, 2023, 23:59 SGT**.

## Final Note

Every problem in this set can be solved with concepts you've learned. Refrain from using data structures or algorithms outside the course material, such as hashmaps. If you're considering such methods, you might be overthinking!
